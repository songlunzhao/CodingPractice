//You are given two integers height and width representing a garden of size heig
//ht x width. You are also given: 
//
// 
// an array tree where tree = [treer, treec] is the position of the tree in the 
//garden, 
// an array squirrel where squirrel = [squirrelr, squirrelc] is the position of 
//the squirrel in the garden, 
// and an array nuts where nuts[i] = [nutir, nutic] is the position of the ith n
//ut in the garden. 
// 
//
// The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four d
//irections: up, down, left, and right, to the adjacent cell. 
//
// Return the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put 
//them under the tree one by one. 
//
// The distance is the number of moves. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: height = 5, width = 7, tree = [2,2], squirrel = [4,4], nuts = [[3,0], [
//2,5]]
//Output: 12
//Explanation: The squirrel should go to the nut at [2, 5] first to achieve a mi
//nimal distance.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: height = 1, width = 3, tree = [0,1], squirrel = [0,0], nuts = [[0,2]]
//Output: 3
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= height, width <= 100 
// tree.length == 2 
// squirrel.length == 2 
// 1 <= nuts.length <= 5000 
// nuts[i].length == 2 
// 0 <= treer, squirrelr, nutir <= height 
// 0 <= treec, squirrelc, nutic <= width
