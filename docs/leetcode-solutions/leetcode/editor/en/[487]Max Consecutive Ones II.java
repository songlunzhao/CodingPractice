//Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the
// array if you can flip at most one 0. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the maximum number of consecutive 1s
//. After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
//Output: 4
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105 
// nums[i] is either 0 or 1. 
// 
//
// 
// Follow up: What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream
//? In other words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too
// large to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?
