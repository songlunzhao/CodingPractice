//Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL
//. 
//
// TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://lee
//tcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tiny
//url.com/4e9iAk. 
//
// Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no res
//triction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensur
//e that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the
// original URL.
