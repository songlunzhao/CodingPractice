//We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 are
// rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively. When 2, 3, 4, 5 an
//d 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid. 
//
// A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a differ
//ent number with each digit valid.(Note that the rotated number can be greater th
//an the original number.) 
//
// Given a positive integer n, return the number of confusing numbers between 1 
//and n inclusive. 
//
// 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: n = 20
//Output: 6
//Explanation: 
//The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19].
//6 converts to 9.
//9 converts to 6.
//10 converts to 01 which is just 1.
//16 converts to 91.
//18 converts to 81.
//19 converts to 61.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: n = 100
//Output: 19
//Explanation: 
//The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19,60,61,66,68,80,81,86,89,90,91,98,99
//,100].
//

//
// Note: 
//
// 
// 1 <= n <= 109
